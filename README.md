### üõ† Tools

Efforts have been put on fast **onboarding** and **developer experience**.

This project comes with extensive support for TypeScript, Astro, Vue, Tailwind, and VS Code.  
It is configured with sensible defaults, a bit of opinions, plus some tricks to make it plays nice together.

- **TypeScript**: _strictest_ Astro's settings. Full-stack, type-safe code base
- **Prettier**: featuring `prettier-plugin-astro` (bundled with `astro`)
- **Editorconfig**: conforming with prettier
- **VS Code**: extensions recommendations, tooling settings
- **Tailwind**: Astro integration (using Vite and PostCSS)
- **Flowbite**: dependencies (core, typography), settings
